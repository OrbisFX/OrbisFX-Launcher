## v0.2.0

Onboarding polish + updates that don't suck.

### What's new

- **One-click updates** — Download finishes, hit "Install & Restart", done. No more hunting for the installer in your downloads folder.

### Improvements

- **Tutorial spotlight** — The tutorial now dims everything except what it's pointing at. Way easier to follow.
- **Update dialog** — Redesigned to match the rest of the app. Shows you exactly what version you're on vs. what you're updating to.

### No longer broken

- **Tutorial buttons staying visible** — The Next/Skip buttons used to get cut off when you resized the window. Fixed.
